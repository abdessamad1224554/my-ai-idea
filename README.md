#My AI Idea
This project proposes a simple AI tool designed to help high school students prepare for exams.  
The idea is to build an AI assistant that can:

- Generate practice exercises in mathematics, physics, and languages  
- Provide step-by-step explanations  
- Create personalized study plans based on the student’s level  
- Help students track their progress  

This idea fits within the goal of using artificial intelligence to improve education and accessibility to learning resources.

This project was created as part of the *Building AI course by MinnaLearn and the University of Helsinki*
